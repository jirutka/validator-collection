Neither http://beanvalidation.org/1.1/spec/[Bean Validation 1.1] (JSR 303/349) nor http://hibernate.org/validator/[Hibernate Validator], the reference _(and the only one…)_ implementation of it, provide simple way to validate a collection of basic types like String, Integer, Date… (i.e. validate each element of the collection).

This library allows you to easily create a “pseudo constraint” (typically named as `@EachX`) for _any_ validation constraint to annotate a collection of simple types, without writing an extra validator or unnecessary wrapper classes for every collection.
`EachX` constraint is supported for all standard Bean Validation constraints and Hibernate specific constraints.
For example:

[source]
----
@EachSize(min = 5, max = 255)
Collection<String> values;

@EachFuture
List<Date> dates;

@EachEmail
Set<String> emails;
----


== How to create a custom constraint

Every `@EachX` pseudo constraint uses the same validator, link:src/main/java/cz/jirutka/validator/collection/CommonEachValidator.java[CommonEachValidator].
To create an `@EachAwesome` for your own `@Awesome` constraint, just copy & paste the annotation class (i.e. all the attributes and boilerplate meta annotations), replace `@Constraint` annotation with `@Constraint(validatedBy = CommonEachValidator.class)` and add the annotation `@EachConstraint(validateAs = Awesome.class)`.
That’s all!

[source]
----
// common boilerplate
@Documented
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({METHOD, FIELD, ANNOTATION_TYPE})
// this is important!
@EachConstraint(validateAs = Awesome.class)
@Constraint(validatedBy = CommonEachValidator.class)
public @interface EachAwesome {

    // copy&paste all attributes from Awesome annotation here
    String message() default "";
    Class<?>[] groups() default {};
    Class<? extends Payload>[] payload() default {};
    String someAttribute();
}
----


=== The old way

The previous versions (before 2.1.0) used a different approach to write `@EachX` annotations (see https://github.com/{gh-name}/tree/v2.0.2[here]).
It is still supported for custom constraints, but all the built-in annotations has been already updated to the new style.

If you’re upgrading from an older version of Collection Validators, then you must update all built-in annotations to the new style.
For example:

[source]
@EachSize(@Size(min = 5, max = 255)) -> @EachSize(min = 5, max = 255)

You _should_ also update custom annotations.
The old style is still supported, but may be deprecated in the future.


== Maven

Released versions are available in The Central Repository.
Just add this artifact to your project:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim, attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>{group-id}</groupId>
    <artifactId>{artifact-id}</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

However if you want to use the last snapshot version, you have to add the JFrog OSS repository:

[source, xml]
----
<repository>
    <id>jfrog-oss-snapshot-local</id>
    <name>JFrog OSS repository for snapshots</name>
    <url>https://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local</url>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
</repository>
----


== Requirements

http://hibernate.org/validator/[Hibernate Validator] 4.3.1.Final and newer is supported, but 5.× is recommended.

Please note that on older versions some Hibernate specific constraints doesn’t exist, so their `@EachX` annotations will not work (e.g. `@EachEAN`, `@EachMod10Check`, …).
It’s described in JavaDoc.


=== Version detection

In order to support multiple versions of Hibernate Validator at a time, we attempt to determine what version is being used at runtime using the package metadata for the `HibernateValidator` class.
This can sometimes fail, particularly if your project creates an “uber JAR.”
If the version cannot be detected, then it fallbacks to ≥ 5.1.0.
