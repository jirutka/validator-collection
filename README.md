Neither [Bean Validation 1.1][JSR-349] (JSR 303/349) nor [Hibernate Validator], the reference _(and the only one…)_
implementation of it, provide simple way to validate a collection of basic types like String, Integer, Date… (i.e.
validate each element of the collection).

This library allows you to easily create a “pseudo constraint” (typically named as `@EachX`) for _any_ validation
constraint to annotate a collection of simple types, without writing an extra validator or unnecessary wrapper classes
for every collection. `EachX` constraint is supported for all standard Bean Validation constraints and Hibernate
specific constraints. For example:

```java
@EachSize(min = 5, max = 255)
Collection<String> values;

@EachFuture
List<Date> dates;

@EachEmail
Set<String> emails;
```

How to create a custom constraint
---------------------------------

Every `@EachX` pseudo constraint uses the same validator, [CommonEachValidator]. To create an `@EachAwesome` for your
own `@Awesome` constraint, just copy&paste the annotation class (i.e. all the attributes and boilerplate meta
annotations), replace `@Constraint` annotation with `@Constraint(validatedBy = CommonEachValidator.class)` and add the
annotation `@EachConstraint(validateAs = Awesome.class)`. That’s all!

```java
// common boilerplate
@Documented
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({METHOD, FIELD, ANNOTATION_TYPE})
// this is important!
@EachConstraint(validateAs = Awesome.class)
@Constraint(validatedBy = CommonEachValidator.class)
public @interface EachAwesome {

    // copy&paste all attributes from Awesome annotation here
    String message() default "";
    Class<?>[] groups() default {};
    Class<? extends Payload>[] payload() default {};
    String someAttribute();
}
```

### The old way

The previous versions (before 2.1.0) used a different approach to write `@EachX` annotations (see
[here](https://github.com/jirutka/validator-collection/tree/v2.0.2)). It is still supported for custom constraints, but
all the built-in annotations has been already updated to the new style.

If you’re upgrading from an older version of Collection Validators, then you must update all built-in annotations
to the new style. For example:

    @EachSize(@Size(min = 5, max = 255)) -> @EachSize(min = 5, max = 255)

You _should_ also update custom annotations. The old style is still supported, but may be deprecated in the future.


Maven
-----

Released versions are available in The Central Repository. Just add this artifact to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>cz.jirutka.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>validator-collection</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.4</version>
</dependency>
```

However if you want to use the last snapshot version, you have to add the Sonatype OSS repository:

```xml
<repository>
    <id>sonatype-snapshots</id>
    <name>Sonatype repository for deploying snapshots</name>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
</repository>
```

Requirements
------------

[Hibernate Validator] 4.3.1.Final and newer is supported, but 5.× is recommended.

Please note that on older versions some Hibernate specific constraints doesn’t exist, so their `@EachX` annotations will
not work (e.g. `@EachEAN`, `@EachMod10Check`, …). It’s described in JavaDoc.

### Version detection

A note on versions: in order to support multiple versions of hibernate at a time, we attempt to determine what hibernate version is being used at runtime using the package metadata
for the `HibernateValidator` class. This can sometimes fail, particularly if your project creates an uber jar. If version detection isn't working properly, you can explicitly tell
the library which version is in use by including a file `validator-collection-hibernate-version.txt` on the classpath. This file should contain exactly one line, with the version string. For example:

    5.1.3.Final
